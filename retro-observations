We will pick an approach and review after each ensemble cycle

What did we do:
Agreed direction and approach
Chat between 5 minute coding sessions is helpful
Tidying up code and refactoring names was helpful
Fixed data files
Used the "fake-it" approach on one of the tests.

Observations
Adding print lines to get through a test suggests the tests are too big
(print lines are a debugging tool)
Having a higher level list of what we are doing would be helpful (e.g. a user journey map)

Questions
Are we going too fast? e.g. do we _all_ understand the list comprehension
We are we not using the python csv package?

Feelings
Felt good
Taking a couple of minutes between 'rounds' to re-orient helped everyone stay engaged
returning to the the user story each time kept us aligned
